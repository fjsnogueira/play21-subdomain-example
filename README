This is an example of a Play 2.1 application
============================================

This application is a proof of concept (with related tests) of my branch feature-subdomain in Play20.

This is auick example of a small web application in Play 2.1 that can match subdomains in routes.
The patch enables to :
- use Include files (for example, if you want to have an api.example.com defined in an external api.routes files)
- have domain params (for example, if you want to match http://[username].example.com/ to your controller)
- get the subdomain easily (by providing a 'subdomain' param in the controllers actions)

Any comments about it are welcome.
